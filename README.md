# All Algorithms In Java

![Algorithms](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41565823/46194932-22257b00-c303-11e8-819a-60b02719faa0.jpeg)

This is the collection of all the algorithms, that are widely used in Java.
This holds all the basic and advanced algrithms which are widely used for **sorting, searching, moving** and others. 

This repository will be **updated regularly, with more and new algorithms,** for different kinds of problems.

I would also include some of those algorithms/tricks that **I learnt while competing in coding competitions, online and offline.** This would be something that you would want to look at least once, everytime before you go out for coding something efficiently.
